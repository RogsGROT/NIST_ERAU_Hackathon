Project Overview
This project involves identifying the most likely missing frames from a dataset using various analytical methods. The primary goal was to detect missing frames that were not captured during data collection due to potential technical issues. The analysis leverages different methods to determine which frames are most likely missing based on their differences.

Problem Definitions
1. Scenario 1: Missing Images Retrieved
In this scenario, the missing frames have been retrieved, and the task is to correctly place them back into the sequence of captured frames. The challenge lies in determining the exact location where each missing frame belongs. Accurate placement is critical to maintaining the sequence's integrity and ensuring that subsequent analysis or processing is based on the correct order of frames.

2. Scenario 2: Missing Images Lost
In this scenario, some images were lost during the data collection process, and the task is to identify where these losses occurred. Only the captured frames are available, and the challenge is to pinpoint the locations in the sequence where frames were missed. This is essential for understanding the extent of data loss and for planning any necessary corrective actions.
